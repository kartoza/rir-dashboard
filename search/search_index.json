This panel can be accessed under the indicators tab which is visible when the user has selected the context analysis icon which is located above the Programme interventions bar. Each indicator falls under a group. The severity levels refer to how good or bad the case is for that factor within the instance. This ranges from worst-case scenario to best-case scenario. The case of the scenario will indicate if that region or state needs additional response or intervention. Indicators \u00b6 The indicators in the panel are divided into groups. Each group has a drop-down arrow and contains a subset of indicators inside. This allows you to activate data for each group or allows you to be more specific and select data to be displayed from an indicator within the group. To display activate data from a group or an indicator \"check\" their checkboxes which will show with a tick. Groups can be expanded or collapsed by \"clicking\" on the triangle next to the name of the group. If there is a little black dot in the coloured circle next to the group or indicator, a custom dashboard will open when that circle is clicked. Traffic Light \u00b6 To view the traffic lights, \"expand\" the indicators panel by \"clicking\" on the arrow for \u2018full screen\u2019 as indicated in the clip below. This will open the full indicator information page and allow you to look at the severity level for each indicator. To view each subsection in each group, \"expand\" the indicator group. The severity levels displayed are for the entire instance, in this case, they show the indicators and their corresponding severities for Somalia. Download Data \u00b6 If you would like to download data for each group, indicator or even for the whole instance, there are various methods to do so. There is a download option (round icon with a download arrow in it) next to each indicator and group on the 'Indicator panel' as well as on the 'Traffic Light' screen. The option to download data for the entire instance is in the top right corner of the screen. The data will download in the form of an Excel spreadsheet. Downloading data will provide you with country, region, district and IPC level data for the geographic location under observation. Info Panel \u00b6 The Information panel is located on the right-hand side of the screen. It\u2019s only visible when an indicator is selected in the indicator panel. The panel shows the severity case of the selected indicator in each region or district (depending on what has been selected). It also has a graphical representation in the form of a pie chart that displays how many areas within the instance fall within each severity case. By \"hovering\" your mouse over the pie chart, you can see these values in a pop-up label. You can also download the data for that specific indicator in the info panel. The download icon is circled in red in the image below. To view the severity levels of each indicator for a specific location, \"click\" on a region or district on the map. This should create a pop-up window on the screen as previously discussed in the 'Map Interactions' document. It should also create a tab in the 'Info Panel' called 'Indicators'.","title":"Indicator"},{"location":"introduction/platform_tour/indicator/#indicators","text":"The RIR dashboard displays various indicators and their corresponding severity levels in the indicator panel.

Moving Around the Map \u00b6 To \"pan\" around the map, you need to \"click\" down with your mouse and \"drag\" the map around. The map will continue to pan for as long as the mouse is clicked in. To make the map stop moving, \"release\" your mouse. Zooming In and Out \u00b6 There are two ways to zoom in and out. The first is that you can use your scroll on their mouse to zoom in and out. This is the easier of the two methods. The second method can be used when you are looking to zoom into a specific area. This method requires the user to \"click\", \"shift\" and then \"drag\" a square around the area they would like to focus in on. If you are using a scroll pad and not a mouse, you can zoom out by bringing your fingers together on your trackpad and zoom out by moving them away from each other on your trackpad. Information Display Window \u00b6 To gain information on a specific area within the map, \"click\" on that area with your mouse. By clicking on an area, a popup window with information related to your selected layers for that area will be displayed on the screen. This action will also change the info window in the \u2018Summary Tab' to the \u2018Indicators Tab'. You can also view more details by \"clicking\" on \u2018details\u2019 in the popup window. This will also change the info window\u2019s tab to the \u2018Details Tab'. The Slide Deck \u00b6 If you have two indicators selected to display on the map at the same time, it will turn to be compare mode. You will see the name and severity levels on the bottom right and left of the screen indicate the side of indicators. To move between the two sets of data \"drag\" the vertical line, that extends from the top of the screen to the bottom, left to right. This feature allows the user to analyse more than one indicator at a time without having to deselect and select another indicators. By clicking on the little map icon at the bottom left of the screen, you can change the slide deck function from vertical to horizontal. Timelapse Bar \u00b6 The Timelapse Bar will show you the severity of the selected indicator over a period of time. As the map and the info panel change, the corresponding date for that data will be displayed within the bar. You can slide the green bar to select the date, or you can start autoplay by \"clicking\" on the \"play\" button. \"Click\" \"stop\" to stop the autoplay. Administrative Level \u00b6 Every indicator has administrative levels that we can select. By default, it will select the lowest administration level. To change it, you can click one of level on the right-bottom list of levels (left-bottom for second indicator in compare mode).

To fully understand the platform and the information you can obtain from it, you need to understand how it works. 1. Programme Interventions Panel \u00b6 This group of buttons is used to navigate through the key areas of factors or indicators that the RIR platform accounts for. If you have admin status, more icons will be available within the panel, we will explore these additional buttons at a later stage. Each button will take you to a page as seen in the image below which will give you the intervention status of the geographic region for that specific factor. The factors in order from top to bottom are; education, child protection, nutrition, wash, and education. To return to the dashboard, \"click\" on the 'Context Analysis' icon which is represented as a little home symbol. 2. The Indicator Panel \u00b6 This panel contains a list of indicators that relate to the factors accounted for by the platform. The coloured circles next to each indicator show the current severity level for that indicator within the specific geographic region. The indicators are arranged in groups that have an overall severity level for that group next to the group name. The entire collection of indicators is also given an overall status which is displayed at the top of the list. An in-depth tour of the indicators and how they work will follow. 3. The Indicator Icon \u00b6 This button expands and collapses the indicator panel if the button is in blue as illustrated in the image below. 4. The Layers Icon \u00b6 By clicking on this icon, you expand the 'Layers Panel'. This panel is where you can select or deselect the layers you want to be visible on the map canvas. The layers that you have visible should coincide with the information you are trying to obtain from the platform. 5. The Basemap Icon \u00b6 To expand or collapse the basemap panel, \"click\" on this icon. When expanded, you will be able to choose which basemap you would like to be displayed on your canvas extent. 6. Map \u00b6 The map displays a geographic area based on the instance being used. In this case, it\u2019s Somalia. The information that is displayed on the map is determined by the layers that are selected as well the factors that have been selected within the 'Indicator Panel'. A complete guide of the map and accompanying interactions will be available in a document to follow. 7. The Info Button \u00b6 The 'Info Button' expands a panel that contains a summary of the severity of the selected indicators in different locations within the geographic area. It also has an 'Indicators' option to select which illustrates the severity of all the factors for a specific location within the geographic area, this location can be selected by using your mouse and simply \"clicking\" on the area of interest. 8. Geography Level Panel \u00b6 This panel allows you to view the area of interest at a country, region, and district geography level. 9. Graphical Representation \u00b6 This pie chart illustrates the severities of the selected indicators for the whole geographical area or instance. This chart gives you the cumulative total of each severity out of the total number of regions or districts (depending on your settings in the geography level panel). To find out how many regions or districts fall within a specific severity level, \"run\" your mouse over that area of the pie chart. 10. Timelapse Bar \u00b6 The 'Timelapse Bar' will show you the severity of the selected indicators over some time. As the map and the 'Info Panel' change, the corresponding date for that data will be displayed within the bar. To initiate the time-lapse, \"click\" on the \"play\" button. 11. Links Button \u00b6 If you \"click\" on the \"links\" button, a dropdown menu appears. These are the various links to the different servers that the RIR platform connects to. 12.

This tutorial shows you how to manage the platform as an administrator. Working with this documentation \u00b6 Whenever you see a phrase in bold , it refers to a link or button on the user interface that you can interact with. Important Links \u00b6 RIR Platform RIR Full Documentation \ud83d\udcd2 Note: You can find all the sample data used in this tutorial here Session Outline \u00b6 \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb This session is divided into two parts: Part 1: General Platform Administration covering User Management: Creating and editing user profiles. Managing Instances: Creating new and editing preexisting instances. Managing Context Layers: Adding layers from services such as ArcGIS online, GeoNode or GeoServer to create a context layer in the platform. Geography management: Adding geography levels to your instance. Part 2: Indicator Administration covering Indicator management: Adding indicators to the dashboard. Forms: used to manually capture indicator data by filling in forms. Ingestors: Used to manually import data by uploading spreadsheets. Harvesters: Automatic agents which fetch data and add it to indicators on a regular basis. Part 1: General Platform Administration \u00b6 Here is an overview of the general platform administration. \ud83d\udcd2 Note : The following sections all require admin user permissions. There are two key activity areas for administering the RIR platform. Django admin RIR Platform admin Django admin is used for more technical activities and provides a more generic user interface. The RIR Platform admin area is integrated into the frontend of the site and can be used to manage instances, geographies and indicators. Signing In \u00b6 \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Before you can administer the platform, you need to sign in with a user with administrator rights. In the top right-hand corner of the screen is the Sign In button. Here, you will sign in using your admin username and password. This process is the same for a regular user and an admin user. Users and Permissions \u00b6 \ud83d\udca1 This activity will use the django admin interface. Next, we will look at how to manage users. Go to site administration by clicking Admin -> Django Admin . Click on +Add in the same row as \u2018Users\u2019. You can now create a profile for someone by adding a username and password. Once you have created the user profile, click Save . \ud83d\udcdd Note: In future the platform will be upgraded to support single sign-on with your Microsoft Teams credentials or similar oauth provider. Once you have created the user account, pressing save will let you edit the personal information for the new user, as well as select or deselect their permission status. Remember to Save your changes. \ud83d\udcd2 Note : If you want to make a user an admin user so that they can carry out the activities described in this tutorial, you should assign them to the Staff group, the Super User group and the Active box should be checked. Creating an instance \u00b6 \ud83d\udca1 This activity will use the RIR admin interface. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Make sure you are signed in as an admin user. Open any existing instance, then click on the instance manager icon on the left of the screen. To create a new instance, click on the Create Instance button at the top right of the screen. On the instance form. add the name of the new instance that you would like to create, a description, as well as the icon file. The icon file in most cases would be the flag of the country for the instance. Once you have added all of the information, click Save . For this tutorial, we will create a demonstrator instance for South Africa: The flag we used in this exercise is available here: Note: You can find all the sample data used in this tutorial (including this flag image) here . Once your new instance is created, you will be able to open it from the instance chooser. It will appear very empty, like this: Adding a new Context layer \u00b6 \ud83d\udca1 This activity will use the django admin interface. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb In this section we will explain how to create and manage context layers. What is a context layer? Context layers are shown on the map to provide a sense of the conditions in the region. They can cover any topic - for example, security, food security, infrastructure, etc. Context layers do not have indicator data attached, they are a visual aid in the dashboard map. Context layers are normally hosted on another server e.g. ArcGIS Online, GeoServer, and GeoNode all provide ways to publish context layers. Note: For more information about context layers see the user tutorial on this topic. To add a context layer to the RIR instance, you will need a link to an online layer. For this exercise will be adding a context layer from geonode showing homelands : \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb The process for finding the link to an online layer so it can be used as a context layer differs per platform the layer is hosted on. For Geonode layers we need to open the layer in Geonode, right-click on the browser page, click on inspect, and then select network. Hard refresh your screen and look through the URL links until you see the layer URL. For our example, we will use the URL below. Please copy it: https://staging.osgs.rir.kartoza.com/geoserver/ows?access_token=SWMqWx64T5dOsNwPD72o4uIbtZ7FIA&LAYERS=geonode%3Aformer_homelands_polygon&TRANSPARENT=TRUE&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetMap&STYLES=&FORMAT=image%2Fpng&SRS=EPSG%3A900913&BBOX=2504688.5425,-3757032.81375,3757032.81375,-2504688.5425&WIDTH=256&HEIGHT=256 \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Now we can create the context layer in the RIR platform. Click on your account menu in the top right corner of the RIR platform and open Django Admin . Click on +Add on the Context Layers line. Select the instance you would like to add the context layer to. We will use the instance that we have just created, South Africa. Paste the URL that you copied above into the URL box. Enter the information in the form as shown in the images below and save the form once you are happy with it. Click on View Site to see your new layer. You will be able to see your new layer in the Context Layers panel. Geography Management \u00b6 Adding a Geography level \u00b6 \ud83d\udca1 This activity will use the django admin interface. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Geography levels express the hierarchy between administrative boundaries. For example in South Africa we have the national boundary subdivided into provinces, which are in turn subdivided into districts, then municipalities. RIR uses these geography levels to provide a way to group the information from the indicators into administrative units. \u26a0 Geography levels are shared globally across all RIR instances, so be careful when adding, deleting or renaming a level that you do not impact other users. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Let\u2019s start in Site Administration . Scroll down to Geometry Level Instances and click +Add . Set the name and description to your geography level - in our case we will use 'Province' (do not re-add the Province level instance if it already exists). Geometry levels are heirarchical and follow the political organisation of countries. For example 'Country', 'Province', 'District' etc. Establishing the hierarchy \u00b6 \ud83d\udca1 This activity will use the RIR admin interface. Geography levels are heirarchical and follow the political organisation of countries. For example 'Country', 'Province', 'District' etc. We need to explicitly tell the system which levels are the parent and child of each other. To do this we use the Geography Level Management tool. Click on the Geography Management button on the left of the screen. Then click on the Geography Level Management button. Now drag and drop the levels you want to establish the hierarchy between. Having done this, the system will 'know' that provinces fall under the country boundary. Press the Submit button to save the changes. Uploading Geography Boundaries \u00b6 \ud83d\udca1 This activity will use the RIR admin interface. Go back to the main page of your instance. Below the Program Interventions panel are three icons; Indicator Management , Geography Management , and Instance Management . Click on the Geography Management icon.\u00b4 You will be redirected to the geography view map page, and you will see that in the top right corner there is an +uploader button. Select this button and start filling in the form. We will create two new geographies: Country and Provices using the tutorial data supplied below: \ud83d\udcd2 Note: You can find all the sample data used in this tutorial here: Data The geography boundary should be provided in either Esri Shapefile format or as a geojson file. Add the country layer first. Start by clicking the files button at the bottom of the form and then select **all* of the shapefile layers. Now complete the rest of the details as per the screenshot below. Note that the country geography does not need a parent, but we need the code for a country level. In this case, the country is ZA (under 'adm0_pcode'). For a province level, the code column is 'pr_code', the name column is 'pr_name', and the parent code column is 'c_pcode'. Part 2: Managing Indicators \u00b6 Here is an overview of what we will cover in this section: Adding a New Indicator \u00b6 \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Indicators are special layers in RIR that are linked to the situation in the region. Indicators are used to show the situation in the region. For example, in South Africa, there may be indicators for the number of people living in poverty, the number of people living in high crime areas, etc. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb To add an indicator, click on Indicator Management on the main platform page for the instance and go to Create New . Fill in the necessary information about the indicator you would like to create. Let's create an indicator for population per province. We have already added province admin areas to the instance. The following little screen cast gives a short overview of the process: Set up your indicator with the following details: Field Value Name Population Description Population of South Africa Access Level Need login to access Short Code pop Group Demographics Frequency 365 Geometry Reporting Level Province Unit People Reporting Behaviour Most recent for each geography Aggregation Behavioud Aggregate data by the sum of all data in the levels Maximum Value 15000000 Dashboard Link (leave blank) \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Once you have filled out the form, scroll down to Scenario Rules and add the parameters to match the indicator as per the table below. Field Value Best Case \ud83d\udcd4 Note: We are using a contrived example here. In a real instance we would used factors like people in need, COVID infection rates, etc. You can also change the color for each rule by clicking on the color block. Click Submit once you are happy with the added information and scenario rules. \ud83c\udf1f If you add a dashboard link, you will see a black dot in the center of the circle that represents the scenario case on that indicator in the Program Interventions panel. By clicking on the black dot, you will be redirected to the dashboard link. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Once we have created an indicator, we need to populate it with data. There are three ways to do this. We can manually add the data using the value manager form or map. We can use an ingestor to import data from a spreadsheet. We can use a harvester to automatically fetch the data from an online resource. Value Manager Form \u00b6 \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb The value manager form is a table with cells and rows, one row per administrative boundary, and one cell per indicator. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Let's look at how to use the Value Manager Form. To access this form, go to Indicator Management and scroll to the indicator that you would like to add data to. On the right-hand side of the indicator's name, there will be a small Settings symbol. Click on Settings for the desired indicator and then click on Value Manager Form . You will be redirected to a form that gives you all the geographic locations within the instance and fields to add values. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb You can also add a file to fill in the data by clicking Use File to Refill Form . Tee the section: Spreadsheet Uploader below. Value Manager Map \u00b6 \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb The value manager map allows you to add data by directly clicking on the region of the map that you would like to add data to. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb The second way to add data to an indicator is through the Value Manager Map option. Go to Indicator Management and scroll to the indicator that you would like to add data to. On the right-hand side of the indicator's name, there will be a small Settings symbol. Click on Settings for the desired indicator and then \"click\" on Value Manager Map . This will take you back to the map canvas. Now you will be able to click on any geographic location within the instance and a popup window will appear which will allow you to fill in value data for that location. Ingestors \u00b6 \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb The function of an ingestor is to manually populate data for an ingestor. There are three modalities for ingestors: Spreadsheet uploader (for single indicators) Meta Ingestor (for populating multiple indicators) Push API (advanced, allows you to create programmes that push their data to an indicator) We describe the workflow for each of these ingestors below. Spreadsheet Uploader \u00b6 \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Spreadsheet uploader is used for upload data of an indicator using one file. It is using Value Manager Form without input value one by one. We are going to use TrainingData/IngestorData/sa-population.xls . \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb For this example, we are going to use population indicator. Before starts, we need to create the indicator first. (Check Adding a New Indicator section) \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Go to Indicator Management and scroll to the indicator that you would like to add data to. On the right-hand side of the indicator's name, there will be a small Settings symbol. Click on Settings for the desired indicator and then click on Value Manager Form . \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Click Use File to Refill Form and the popup will show. After that select other inputs. \ud83d\udcd2 Note: Always select administrative code to Choose area code column. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb After everything selected, click import , and the form will be autofilled. \ud83d\udcd2 Note: If it is still empty, check the administrative code that you have on spreadsheet and the forms. Always use administrative code on the speadsheet value. On the form, the code is in brackets. Meta Ingestor Uploader \u00b6 \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb We are going to create a Meta Ingestor. The goal for this ingestor is for uploading data for multiple indicator for one file. We are going to use TrainingData/IngestorData/sa-gdp_unemployment.xls. In there, there are gdp and unemployment columns that we need to save the data for gdp and unemployment indicator. Before starts, we need to create those indicators first. (Check Adding a New Indicator section) \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb To start the meta ingestor, go to Indicator Management and in the top right-hand corner of the page, there will be a Meta Ingestor option that you will need to click. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Select the file in TrainingData/IngestorData/sa-gdp_unemployment.xls from the sample data and the other inputs will be activate. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Select Sheet name and Row number: header (It is row 1). \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Select Column name: administration code , and select other Column name inputs (The indicator name) with the header on the Excel that reflects the indicator data. Then Submit your work, and wait until it says done. API Ingestor \u00b6 Note: This is for advanced users only. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb To start, go to indicator management, go to the 'Population' line, click 'cog' symbol and click 'Create Harvester'. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Change the type of harvester to Harvested using exposed API by external client . Add necessary notes and submit. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb It will show the details that we need to use later. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb After that go to postman for example to push data. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Change method to POST. Copy the url on the image above and put it on url on Postman. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Copy the token on the image above, go to postman, go to headers tab. Add new key 'Authorization' with value 'Bearer (token that we paste)'. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Example postman for harvester from above image. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Copy the json that show on the harvester page, and go to postman, go to body tab, change to raw and change to JSON. Paste the json, and change with necessary data. Put correct administrative code in there. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Then click 'Send' on postman. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb If it is success, it will return the detail of data that we pushed before. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Please check full walkthrough below. Harvesters \u00b6 Note: This is for advanced users only. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Harvesters are fully automated software routines that periodically fetch data from third party sources and populate indicators. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Go to Indicator Management and if you haven't already created the indicator you want to work with, start by doing that. Once the necessary indicator exists,click on the little Settings icon on the right-hand side of the indicator name. Select the Create Harvester option. Pick the type of harvester you would like to create from the drop-down Harvester (you will be presented with three options: 'API With Geography Using Today's Date'; 'API With Geography And Date'; and 'Harvested Using Exposed API By External Client'). The first two options are for the harvester and the third one is for the ingestor. For the 'API With Geography Using Today's Date' and 'API With Geography And Date' options, fill in the Attributes portion of the form and then a popup window with a list of keys will appear; drag the green labels to their corresponding criteria. Select Harvest Now . You can scroll down to the log to see if your harvest is running in the background. Go to Indicator Management and click on the little settings icon that you just created a harvester for and select Value Manager Map to view your progress.","title":"Administrator"},{"location":"tutorial/administrator_tutorial/#administrator-tutorial","text":"","title":"Administrator Tutorial"},{"location":"tutorial/administrator_tutorial/#introduction","text":"\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb The RIR (Risk Informed Response) platform is a situational awareness platform to monitor health, child protection, nutrition, wash, and education in a geographic region.

What is a context layer? Context layers are shown on the map to provide a sense of the conditions in the region. They can cover any topic - for example, security, food security, infrastructure, etc. Context layers do not have indicator data attached, they are a visual aid in the dashboard map. Context layers are normally hosted on another server e.g. ArcGIS Online, GeoServer, and GeoNode all provide ways to publish context layers. Note: For more information about context layers see the user tutorial on this topic. To add a context layer to the RIR instance, you will need a link to an online layer. For this exercise will be adding a context layer from geonode showing homelands : \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb The process for finding the link to an online layer so it can be used as a context layer differs per platform the layer is hosted on. For Geonode layers we need to open the layer in Geonode, right-click on the browser page, click on inspect, and then select network. Hard refresh your screen and look through the URL links until you see the layer URL. For our example, we will use the URL below. Please copy it: https://staging.osgs.rir.kartoza.com/geoserver/ows?access_token=SWMqWx64T5dOsNwPD72o4uIbtZ7FIA&LAYERS=geonode%3Aformer_homelands_polygon&TRANSPARENT=TRUE&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetMap&STYLES=&FORMAT=image%2Fpng&SRS=EPSG%3A900913&BBOX=2504688.5425,-3757032.81375,3757032.81375,-2504688.5425&WIDTH=256&HEIGHT=256 \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Now we can create the context layer in the RIR platform.

Dashboard Tour \u00b6 \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Let's tour the dashboard together. We will start from left to right across the screen, showing what each button and panel does with a few simple examples. The Context Analysis Button \u00b6 \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb At the top left of the screen, you will see the Context Analysis Button . This button gives access to the Indicator Panel it is selected, and the is panel open by default. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Below the Context Analysis Button is the Programme Interventions Panel . It contains a set of buttons that allow access to key risk response indicators. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Click on the arrow next to the house symbol, the tabs will extend and be labeled so you can see what each symbol means, Health, Child Protection, Nutrition, Wash, and Education. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb For example, the second button-down with a picture of the caduceus/ medical symbol indicates Health . Once opened the panel shows a report on the status of or degree to which the intervention for that factor is helping and other information like costing. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Click on each button to see the information for each factor. The Indicator Panel \u00b6 \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Click back on the Context Analysis Button and observe the Indicator Panel . \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb This panel contains a list of indicators (special layers) that relate to the main factors of interest on the platform like health and nutrition. Indicators are special layers in RIR that are linked to the situation in the region. Indicators are used to show the situation in the region. For example, in Somalia, there are indicators for the Children in need of protection PIN- Child Protection that we will practically explore below. The panel is expanded by default but can be collapsed if you click on the tab labeled with a house on the right side of the panel. Collapsing the pannel can allow you to observe the map better. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Click on the triangle next to the label People In Need . \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb This opens a drop-down menu showing all the data on different groups of people that require assistance from government or other organizations. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Select the box next to PIN- Child Protection . \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb A tick will appear in the check box and you will see a layer appear on the map. The map shows areas in darkening blue shades that indicate a decrease in child protection per region. You can select only one sub-layer (e.g. best-case or worst-case) of the indicator layer by ticking or un-ticking the checkboxes next to each of the cases. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Click and unclick the different case options (see how the map changes). Ensure all of the PIN- Child Protection sub-Layers are ticked to continue with the tutorial. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb An Information panel will also open on the right-hand side of the screen when an indicator is selected. We will go through the Information Panel in more detail shortly. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb The coloured circles next to each indicator show the current severity level for that indicator. Blue is the best case, yellow mid, and red is the worst case. The case scenario will indicate if that region or state needs additional responses or interventions to reduce risk. The Traffic Light \u00b6 \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb You can access what we call traffic lights for the indicators by clicking on the arrow in the top right of the Indicator panel . This will expand the information on the severity level, for example, you can see that for our selected layer of PIN- Child Protection overall in Somalia the situation is worsening for children hence the yellow color. Several regions need additional responses or support to protect vulnerable children. Click the triangle (now on the top right) again to see the map again. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Click on the arrow in the top right of the Indicator panel The Information Panel \u00b6 \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb On the right-hand side of the map area, the Information Panel shows a summary of the severity case of the indicator selected for each region or district. For example in Adan Yabaal Child protection has a value of 3. You will also see an interactive pie chart infographic summarising all the data in the layer. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Hover your mouse over the pie chart and observe the labels and number of districts in Worsening and Worst Case scenarios. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb If you click on the region name like Adan Yabaal in the Information Panel the platform will show which region it is on the map with an information window. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Click on Adan Yabaal (the text) in the Information Panel under the pie chart. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Once a single district is selected, the Information Panel will show all the indicators for that specified region and the severity of the situation for each indicator using different traffic light colors. You can click on each indicator for more detail like Child protection and you will see more information and a simple infographic. We will look at the Information Panel with different data further on in this tutorial and show how the simple infographic in the detail section can show changes over time if the data has such information. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Click on PiN-Child Protection (the text) in the Information Panel and observe the information and simple Infographic and hover your mouse over it. Downloading Data Button \u00b6 \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb You can download any data of interest by clicking on the round symbol with the download arrow in it ( download button ) next to each indicator in the Indicator Panel for the selected indicator. You can get all the data for the instance if you click the download button at the top of the Information Panel . This will give you a spreadsheet of the information that you can use outside of the platform. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Click on the download button next to People In Need and observe the downloaded spreadsheet on your computer. Note the data is also colour-coded in the spreadsheet as per the platform. Layers \u00b6 \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Let's explore the layers available to visualize and give context to the indicators on the map. Context Layers \u00b6 \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb The context layers can be accessed by clicking on the button with 3 overlapping squares on it. There will be a list of options to choose from. Context layers are shown on the map to provide a sense of the conditions in the region. They can cover any topic - for example, security, food security, infrastructure, etc. Context layers do not have indicator data attached, they are a visual aid in the dashboard map. Let's Select \u2018Access\u2019 We can now see all the roads, airports, and other access indicators/features. If you click on the drop-down triangle you can choose exactly what features you want to see and Turn off everything except roads and ports by checking and unchecking the feature boxes. If you click on a point on the map like a port you will be given information about that specific point in an Information Window . \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Click on the context layers button, select access layers select only roads and ports. Click on a port and see the information window. Base Maps \u00b6 \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb You can also change the base map behind the data if you click on the world icon in the panel. The default is an OpenStreetMap canvas. There is also a GEBCO grid base map which is a global terrain model for ocean and land, a Mapbox satellite base map, and an open topo base map which is rendered from OSM and SRTM data. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb For example, it may be useful to have a topographic map to visualize geographic features like mountains and rivers that could impede people's movement into areas if you are reviewing the internal displacement of people. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb - turn on the Open Topo Map base map - Navigate back to the indicator panel - Uncheck the child protection layer. - Click the drop-down for Internal Displacement - select the IDP Departure layer \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb You can now see some of the topographic features underneath the departures layer. You may observe that several areas with high departure rates are in the northern desert area. Thus drought may be affecting the people in these areas. Let's take it a step further and go to the contest layers again drop down the Natural Hazard option and check on the Drought Priority Areas . You can see that many of the drought priority areas are in the northern desert area we can see on the context topo map. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Navigate to the context layers and check on the Drought Priority Areas . Geography Level \u00b6 \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Finally, while we have the IDP data handy you can change the Geography Level of the indicators. By specifying country, region, or district in the menu on the bottom right of the map canvas. Geography levels express the hierarchy between administrative boundaries. For example, in Somalia, we have the country boundary subdivided into regions, which are in turn subdivided into districts. RIR uses these geography levels to provide a sense of the conditions in the region. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb - Turn off the Acess layers and the Drought Priority Areas by going to the layers and unchecking them so that we can see the regions better - On the menu at the bottom right of the page select Region and you will see that the geographic level of the areas changes. - click on Country and see what happens. Map Interactions \u00b6 \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Let's now get into interacting with the Map. Activate the child protection indicator again and deactivate departures. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Check on the PIN- Child Protection and check off the IDP Departure layer Zooming \u00b6 \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Zoom into and out of the map by using the scroll wheel on your mouse or you can click your mouse, hold down shift and draw a square around the area you wish to zoom in to. Panning \u00b6 To pan on the map click on the map and drag it around. Information Window \u00b6 Once you have zoomed and panned to an area of interest click on it and you will see an information window as we saw earlier. For more information click on the detail button and information will be shown in the Information Panel on the right. Click off the window to get out. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Zoom in, Pan, and click on a region of interest. The Slider \u00b6 \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb You can choose two indicators for comparison on the map. For example, while child protection is selected let's see where there is program coverage for child protection in Somalia. Under the Program Coverage indicator select the Child Protection option. You will see a slider appear and the layer names represented on each side on the bottom left and right of the screen. If you click on the middle toggle and drag you can see that in several of the regions in the north with the worst-case scenario for child protection there are no active programs to combat the issue depicted in red. These would be ideal candidates to fund child-relief projects in. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Check on the Child Protection indicator layer and drag the slider across the map. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb You can make the sliding horizontal by clicking the map button at the bottom right of the map canvas. Timelapse Bar \u00b6 There is a Timelapse Bar that can show changes in data over time located at the bottom center of the screen or map area. A great example of this is the internal displacement of people. Turn off the child protection indicators and activate the IDP layer for departures. You can see where indicators are selected because the tab heading will be bolded. Click the play button on the time bar and you will see the changes in what region people are leaving over time. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Check the box on the IDP Departure layer and any other layers off. Click on the green play button on the timelapse bar. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb People will leave due to conflict, drought, and other reasons. This is also interesting to compare to IDP arrivals using the slide bar to see where people are leaving and what regions they are going to who may need extra financial and technical support. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Check the box on the IDP Arrivals layer and use the slider to compare the two layers. More on the Information Panel \u00b6 \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb While the IDP Departures is open, let's look at the last options and functionalities on the Information Panel . If the Information Panel is minimized or you want to minimize it. Click on the blue Info button that looks like a tab on the right-side panel to maximize and minimize it. Inside the information panel, there is a summary of all the region/or districts and for example how many people departed that area because we are looking at the departures layer. Graphical Representation \u00b6 \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb The graphical representation of the scenarios in this case a pie chart showing the proportion of best-case regions to worst-case and the status quo. You can hover your mouse over the chart and interact with it. For example, it will show that the best case is the reality for 54 out of the 73 districts in a pop-up label. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Hover your mouse over the pie chart and observe the labels and number of districts in different scenarios. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Further click on the name Adan Yabaal and in the Indicators select IDP departure . This will open the details panel where you can see a line graph showing the change over time for the Adan Yabaal district as well as other pertinent information. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Click on Adan Yabaal (the text) in the Information Panel under the pie chart, click on IDP Departures (the text) and observe and hover your mouse over the line chart. Bringing it all together \u00b6 \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb With your knowledge of the RIR dashboard try an analysis where we look at what districts people are departing from and what districts they are arriving to. Make the context map OpenStreetMap Add the context layer Refugees and IDPs activate both the arrivals and departures indicator layers click on different districts and observe the detail in the information panel slide the slider to see if neighboring districts accept departing people, thus having higher arrivals than previously observed (see the linear graphs to compare).
