1. **Signing In**:
In the top right-hand corner of the screen is the sign-in button. Here, you will sign in using your admin username and password. This process is the same for a staff user 
and an admin user.

2. **Users and Permissions**:
Go to site administration. “click” on ‘+Add’ in the same row as ‘Users’. You can now create a profile for someone by adding a username and password. Once you have created the user profile, “click” ‘Save’.

Once you have created the user account, go back to ‘Site Administration’ and “select” the ‘user’ option. “Select” the user you created and then you can edit their personal information as well as select or deselect their ‘Permissions’. Remember to ‘Save’ your changes.
